List of Mistakes:

- Me.
- *No really me.*
- ***You have no clue, I am an actual living mistake, really it's amazing.***
- Honestly, people too.
- Ok come on! __*You know they're disgusting too!*__
- **They're so awful!** They're worse than children!
- The one yesterday got angry after losing a game.
- When they don't get what they want, **they grasp away with their sharp nails at our throats, until the ugly flesh is shown.**
- **Give me one reason not to dispose of them. All of them, as their hands reach from the mud below, dragging our feet down into the cesspool of human essence.**
